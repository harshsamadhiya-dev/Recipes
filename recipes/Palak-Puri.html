        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Also called alternatively as Spinach puri, palak puri is an unleavened deep-fried bread made with wheat flour and spinach puree. The latter is the prime ingredient that sets it apart from a normal puri and gives it a beautiful deep green colour that complements any side dish you pair the purris with. Spinach in itself is quite a nutritious vegetable. It is home to several integral vitamins and minerals that support growth and development. Moreover, this vegetable delivers a mild earthy flavour when combined with different spices in the palak puri recipe, making for a delectable dish. These palak puris can be best served with cool raitas, tangy chutney or even indulgent curries and warm lentil soups like dal.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Spinach(palak) puree 1/4 cup</li>
            <li>Atta 1 cup</li>
            <li>Green Chilli Paste 1 tsp</li>
            <li>Ginger Garlic Paste 1/2 tsp</li>
            <li>Salt (to taste)</li>
            <li>Oil (for deep-frying)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Now before we get into assembling the dough for this palak puri recipe, there are two ways to prepare the spinach puree. The first one is to make it yourself, and the second is to use a store-bought one. To do so, you will have to blanch the cleaned spinach in a boiling pot of water for about two minutes. After which, immediately transfer it to a cold water pail to avoid overcooking. This spinach can then be blended into a fine puree. Once all the preparation for the palak puri ingredients is done, let's start assembling the dough. In a mixing bowl, add a cup of Atta, some ginger garlic paste, green chilli paste and spinach puree. Sprinkle some salt over the top and pour in some water.</li>
            <li>Give this palak puri ingredients a good mix, ensuring the dough isn't too watery or dry. You may adjust the consistency with some water and wheat flour. Once well combined, knead this dough for approximately 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Quickly sort and divide the dough into equal-sized dough balls. This helps make the step of rolling the spinach puri a little easier. Clear your counter and dust your rolling board with some Atta. Roll each palak puri dough into a round circle of about 3” in diameter. If getting a round puri shape is a challenge, you may always use a small bowl to cut it into one. </li>
            <li>Now, set a deep kadai with oil on the stove and bring it to medium-high heat. Add a little dough piece to check if the oil is hot enough. If it splutters and puffs, then carefully slide a puri into the hot oil. Fry it until it puffs up and cooks evenly on both sides. Repeat this with all the other rolled palak puri and transfer them to a paper towel to drain excess oil. Your crispy palak puris are ready to be served!</li>
