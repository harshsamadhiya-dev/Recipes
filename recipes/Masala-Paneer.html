        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Paneer, a fresh and versatile soft cheese, is a staple ingredient in Indian Cuisine. Adding spices and herbs while making the paneer transforms it from a simple, plain cheese into a flavorful ingredient that can elevate any dish.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 green cardamoms</li>
            <li>1 cup sliced onion</li>
            <li>1 inch peeled and sliced ginger</li>
            <li>5-6 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>2 cups sliced tomatoes</li>
            <li>15 whole cashew nuts</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon red chilli powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garam masala powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon coriander(dhaniya) powder</li>
            <li>250 to 300 grams paneer</li>
            <li>4 cloves(laung)</li>
            <li>1 to 2 tablespoon coriander leaves(finely chopped)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To a pan, add 1 tablespoon oil, cardamoms, onions, ginger and garlic. Saute for 4 to 5 mins, until the onions turn transparent. (If you are using ginger garlic paste, saute the onions first for 4 mins and then add the ginger garlic paste to saute for a minute or 2)</li>
            <li>Add sliced tomatoes, 1 teaspoon sea salt and cashew nuts.</li>
            <li>Stir well and cover the pan. Cook until the tomatoes turn mushy and break down completely. It takes about 7 to 8 minutes on a medium heat. If your pan is dry, add a splash of water, not a lot. Later stir in the red chili powder, coriander powder and garam masala.</li>
            <li>Saute on a medium heat for 3 to 4 mins, until aromatic. Turn off and cool down.</li>
            <li>Pour 1 cup cold water to a blender jar & transfer the onion tomato masala.</li>
            <li>Blend/grind to a very smooth puree. Taste test to see if you need to increase the heat level.</li>
            <li>At this stage, if you want you may wipe clean the pan with wet kitchen papers but not essential unless you are using a cast iron.</li>
            <li>In the same pan, pour mustard oil on a low heat and add the optional whole spices if using bay leaf, cinnamon and cloves. Let the spices sizzle for 30 seconds and stir in 1/4 teaspoon more chili powder (if you want to adjust the heat level or color).</li>
            <li>Add the onion tomato puree to a strainer, held over the pan. Use a spoon to pass the puree.</li>
            <li>Pour 1/2 cup more water & mix well. Bring to a gentle boil on a medium heat. Cover and cook until thick, about 10 to 12 mins. Keep stirring every 3 to 4 mins, to prevent burning at the bottom. (The gravy is thick and splatters a lot if you cook covered.)</li>
            <li>Add more salt and garam masala at this stage. (taste test before adding more garam masala)</li>
            <li>Stir in the cream.</li>
            <li>Stir the paneer and cover the pan. Cook on a low heat for 2 to 3 mins until heated through. Turn off.</li>
            <li>Garnish with a tablespoon of coriander leaves.</li>
        </ol>
